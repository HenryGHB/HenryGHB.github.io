**Repl.IT Conversations:**

In today's lesson we looked at writing questions into our code and then following the answer up with a response. The question answers would often be multiple choice to make to coding more simple.

It took me a while to figure out what we actually had to do and how to do it. And when I started I struggled for a bit,  it when I got going I did find the work a lot easier then to start with.

Next lesson, I hope that I remember how to use the Repl.IT functions giving that we are about to enter the Christmas holidays and I will forget how to use them.
