    <td>I learnt by typing up the code and by seeing what happens if I typed something different in. This was interesting because I could see what the outcome was. I think that this strategy was effective because I was learning what the code did and how important it was.

  <tr>
    <td>I don't think a lot limited my learning because I feel as if I worked well. But for me the main thing was when the lesson started and people weren't listening and therefore we weren't able to do as much as we wanted to do. But that only took about 5 minutes.

    <td>I think that the thing that I will have to change for next lesson is that if my class listened then I will have more time to do work and therefore I might of been able to get on with a little more. But other than that nothing really has to change.
