  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by typing up what the instructions told me to do. This was an effective strategy as it helped me progress. Although I did struggle a bit so I asked friends who had already done the work to give me hints. This was helpful as the description given to me for as help was clear and that helped me a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was probably that I got stuck on some of the lessons and that I had to ask people what they did to help me. That took some time and that is what I think made me lose some progress. So I probably need to do little things like logging on and getting on to the python web page quicker so I allow time to do things slower.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Like I have previously said, I will probably try to log on the the computer quicker to allow time for silly stuff. I will also try to get onto python quicker as that will allow me more time. I will do this so I have more time to do the lesson. If I get stuck on a lesson then I can ask friends if they can help, then I have more time to do more lessons.</td>
