  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by typing up the solutions which was what the answer was correct. This allowed me to advance and make me go further in my work. This allowed me to reach my target and therefore felt good leaving the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I got a little bit distracted and I talked for the about 10 minutes, this took out a fair portion of the lesson and that made me not make as much progress as I would of wanted to. So I probably need to work on doing more work and not get distracted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to not get distracted as much. That will mean that I will be able to get more work done in the lesson. If I concentrated more than I feel like I could be on a higher percentage than what I am on now.</td>
