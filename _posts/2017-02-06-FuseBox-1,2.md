    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by doing what the guide said to do. But after I changed a few bits of code so I could see what the outcome was whether it was a lot different or similar. Also by doing that I saw what was right and what was wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning the most was how long each display was. This is because when we did the code with the apples the display took 2 minutes to complete. This was not helpful because we ran the display to see if we were doing the code write. So overall it probably took about 10 minutes to the display. So that took away about 20%.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time instead of watching all of the display we will only watch parts of it so we don't waste our time. Although, that might not be good because we could have something wrong at the end of the display. This leave us in a tricky situation. </td>
