  <tr>
    <td>I learnt be thoroughly looking through the explanation and then copying it down as I was trying to remember and if I couldn't then I all look back.

I think that my strategies were effective because I understood more and as well as that i also was remembering well, this helped my a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>If I was quicker at typing and logging on then I would be able to complete more work. I will probably try to work on my habits by practicing typing so I can do more. This means that I will be able to complete a lot more work. This will also help me in my future life.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will probably try to type quicker to improve my learning because I would be able to learn more by going quick. Also if I was earlier to get started then I would probably be able to do more work.</td>
