  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at the booklet and then typed it up on the computer. This was not an effective strategy because all we did was copy it down we didn't work the solution out. This didn't help us learn at all. Really all it helped was our reading. When I go into our next lesson I will try to do a more helpful strategy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the thing that limited my learning the most was the fact that we couldn't go onto the correct computer to set up. This took about 20 minutes which took away just over a third of the lesson. This was not good because we could of probably completed 1,4 if we were quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by trying a new method of learning. Hopefully the new method of learning will be successful and so I can more work in the lesson. Also the new strategy will hopefully be effective to my learning and I can adapt to it easily.</td>
