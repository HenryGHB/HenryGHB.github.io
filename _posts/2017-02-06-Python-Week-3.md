  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions and then typing it up. This strategy was not helpful because I didn't feel like I was learning like I could of and that is why I didn't complete my target. Also I got stuck on one of the lessons for 20 minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to read the instructions through more thoroughly because I got stuck on the lesson for 20 minutes and this meant that I couldn't do as much in the lesson as I wanted to. Also I found out that the answer was very simple and if I read the instructions better then I wouldn't be stuck on it for as long.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will probably read through the instructions more thoroughly before I move onto the typing. I will do this because I got stuck on a lesson for about 20 minutes and that took away a big chunk of my lesson time.
