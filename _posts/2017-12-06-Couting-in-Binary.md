**Counting in Binary:**

In today's IT lesson, we looked at Repl.IT into more detail. We looked at stuff like ranges and how to count in binary. After looking at the presentation the teacher put up on the board and presented to us, we went and looked on a website and the work was on that website, we would then have to do the work.

The work was quite easy as I understand binary, however some of the work we did involved the 'Nth Term' from Maths and Maths is one of my weaker subjects so I struggled with that. 

Next lesson we are going to look at binary in more depth and maybe start to introduce that into our work...
