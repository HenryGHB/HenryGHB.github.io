**Repl.IT Introduction: **

In today's IT lesson the class had to make a conversation on a computer programme called repl.it. We had to use special codes, so when we ran our code then it would make a full conversation. It even answered questions like, how are you feeling today? Then depending on whether you typed in good or bad, it would give you a different response.

I struggled to start with as I found all of the code very confusing and I didn't know how to put all of the colons in different places, the same with brackets. However, when the teacher started to explain it more to the class I found it more clear than before. But I still do struggle with it now. 

Next lesson we are going to look at repl.it more and probably look at more code we can use...
