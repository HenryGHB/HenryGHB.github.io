  <tr>
    <td>I struggled a bit in the lesson because I couldn't really concentrate a lot. So in the lesson I didn’t do as much work as I would of wanted to. That is why I did 15 to 20 minutes as homework (as well as doing my blog and github). So i didn’t really use that many strategies because I took so long doing the work.  </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I have already said I didn’t do as much as I would've liked to do in the lesson, and that is why I needed to do some for homework. That is what limited my learning as if I did more work in the lesson and made more progression then I would be more satisfied with my work. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will probably ask a friend if they were stuck on the same thing on what they did and hopefully they will give me some hints. I only want hints as if they give me the answer the I will not learn to my full potential. Whereas if they give me hints then I will be able to work the answer out myself and I will be able to do better in class.</td>
